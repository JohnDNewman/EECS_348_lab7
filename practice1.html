    <p>
    I am John Newman, a 3rd year student at the University of Kansas, studying computer science. I maintain a solid 3.3 GPA and have taken honor courses where available. In 2022 I attended HackKu and completed a python and html based project to provide various streams of wonderfully cute animal streams to visitors of the site. In high school, 2018 and 2019, I was the sole programmer for my school's newly created robotics team, leading me to develop basic C skills and an understanding of user input problems. I also have experiecne with media design and script writing, as can be seen by the video scripted and performed by yours truly in high school.<br>(As context, the man in the middle has the last name of Bush)
